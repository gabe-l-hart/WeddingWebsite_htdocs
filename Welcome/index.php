			Welcome to our wedding website!  We could not be more excited to share with you our vision for the wedding.
                        We hope you will explore the information provided here in preparation for our August 9<sup>th</sup>-12
                        <sup>th</sup> celebration of love, friendship, and all that is to come.

			We feel there is no better way to celebrate the exciting new phase we will be entering than surrounded by
			those who helped us get here.  As we have envisioned our wedding, our dream has been to spend days rather
			than hours with those we love.  Having lived in Michigan, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, and
			Colorado, we want to gather those who have most supported us as individuals and as a couple along the way,
			drawing upon that love and support as we commit ourselves to one another and the life we will share.

		<p>
			In this spirit, we hope you will join us for our wedding weekend in Westcliffe, Colorado, beginning Thursday,
			August 9<sup>th</sup> and concluding Sunday, August 12<sup>th</sup>.  Housing will be provided for all guests
			at the Red Rock Ranch, a private estate nestled deep in the mountains.  After days of hiking, biking, and
			lounging on the beautiful grounds, take part in our formal ceremony and reception on Saturday, August
			11<sup>th</sup>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please explore the rest of our website to learn more about the Red Rock Ranch, the specifics of the weekend,
			and how to RSVP.  We can not wait for the event to arrive, and we sincerely hope you can be part of this
			special time.
