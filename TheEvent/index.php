<p class="subPageTitle">Logistics of the Weekend</p>

<div class="logisticsBody">

  <p class="descriptionText">
    As with any trip, juggling logistics can be one of the trickiest parts.
    Our goal with this section is to cover some of the important questions
    that will come up as you prepare for the weekend. As part of staying at
    the Red Rock Ranch, every guest will be mailed a welcome packet which
    will contain further details on many logistical questions as well as a
    liability release form.

  </div>
  <p class="descriptionText" style="padding:0px; margin:0px;">
    Guests may arrive Thursday anytime after 3pm and must depart the ranch
    on Sunday by 10am. Detailed directions to the Red Rock Ranch can be found
    <a href="http://ranchretreats.com/tripplanning.html#directions">here</a>
    on their website.

  <p class="descriptionText">
    NOTE: Google Maps is not able to find the Red Rock Ranch's address, so if
    you plan to use a GPS, just enter "Westcliffe, Colorado" and follow the
    end of the directions linked above.

  <!-- Flying -->
  <p class="sectionCaption">Flying to the Red Rock Ranch</p>
  <p class="descriptionText">
    The Red Rock Ranch is located in Westcliffe, Colorado, approximately
    three hours from Denver and one and a half hours from Colorado Springs.
    Flights can be booked into the Denver airport or the Colorado Springs
    airport.  Flights into Denver tend to be slightly cheaper, but driving
    to the Ranch from the Colorado Springs airport is more convenient.
    Feel free to choose whichever option works best for you!
  </p>
  <p class="descriptionText">
    While you will need a car to get from the airport to the Red Rock Ranch,
    we hope to avoid all guests feeling they need to rent a car.  After
    receiving your RSVP, we will send you the contact information for other
    guests whose flights arrive at a similar time.  If you would like to
    share a rental car with others, feel free to contact these guests and
    arrange to carpool.
  </p>

  <p class="sectionCaption">Lodging and Meals</p>
  <p class="descriptionText">
    The Red Rock Ranch consists of three houses, all located together on a
    private estate.  The rooms vary in style and setup, but we will make
    every effort to maximize both space and comfort in organizing the
    specifics of lodging.  Please note that most bathrooms are shared among
    several rooms. 
  </p>
  <p class="descriptionText">
    All meals will be provided at the Red Rock Ranch.  Guests are welcome to
    help themselves to food throughout the day and dinners will be cooked
    communally.
  </p>

  <!-- Children -->
  <p class="sectionCaption">Children</p>
  <p class="descriptionText">
    Please note that babysitting will be provided during the ceremony.
    While kids are welcome throughout the weekend, we ask that families
    with small children utilize this childcare during the ceremony.

  <p class="sectionCaption">Suggested Packing Items</p>
  <p class="descriptionText" style="padding:0px; margin:0px;">

  </p>
  <ul style="float:right;">
    <li>Swimsuit for the pool and Jacuzzi </li>
    <li>
      Warm clothing for evenings; the mountain air is cool, even in
      the summer!
    </li>
    <li>Clothes for outdoor activities, including footwear</li>
    <li>
      Shoes and clothing to exercise, if interested in using the on-site
      fitness facility
    </li>
    <li>
      Camera; guests will have the ability after the wedding to post
      their pictures on this website!
    </li>
    <li>Sunscreen; remember it is easier to get burned at high altitudes!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="descriptionText" style="padding:0px; margin:0px;">
    *Note: While dress throughout the weekend will be casual and
    comfortable, the ceremony and reception on Saturday night will be formal.
